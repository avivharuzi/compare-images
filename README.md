## Overview

This is a web app that take 2 images and compare every pixel using canvas.

There is an option to set the level of the difference between the value in every pixel:

1. RGB - this compare every pixel the rgb value between the images
2. Percent - this just calculates the rgb from the percentage value so for example 1% will be equivalent to 3

The functionality is the same that **implemented** in imagemagick cli but with fewer options, see
